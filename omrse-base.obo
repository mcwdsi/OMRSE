def: "A role borne by a human individual or by a collection of humans regarded as possessing rights and duties enforeable at law." []
comment: We are aware of the fact that Wikipedia's definition differs from ours by saying that "Legal personality (...) is the characteristic of a non-living entity regarded by law to have the status of personhood" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_personality) \nHowever, Shaw explicates:\n"In any legal system, certain entities, whether they be individuals or companies, will be regarded as possessing rights and duties enforceable at law. Thus an individual may prosecute or be prosecuted for assault and a company can sue for breach of contract. They are able to do this because the law recognises them as 'legal persons' possessing the capacity to have and to maintain certain rights, and being subject to perform specific duties. (...) In municipal law individuals, limited companies and public corporations are recognized as each possessing a distinct legal personality, the terms of which are circumscribed by the relevant legislation" (Shaw MN: International Law. Sixth Edition. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2008).                We hold that Shaw's position is ontological more prolific since it not only allows to explain how groups of individuals become recognized as unities at law, but also how different individuals can hold different legal personality roles (always against the context of one legal system). The latter will proof useful when dealing with the representing comatous patients or minorsat law in ontologies.

comment: Broadened from treatment to healthcare services generally.  "Low intensity" is not defined at the moment, but is needed to differentiate from same-day surgery centers or observation stays in hospitals that last <24 hours.  The idea is that few invasive procedures are performed, and the ones that are invasive are not typically much worse than a blood draw.  Maybe bone marrow biopsy is as aggressive as it gets.  I wonder if hematologists do that on an outpatient basis.

name: social identity information content entity
def: "An information content entity that is intended to be a truthful statement about some person and whether that person identifies as some particular aspect of social identity—such as a gender, an ethnicity, a race, or a sexual orientation—where the sense of identifying may correspond to either (i) an aspect of one’s cognitive representation of oneself, (ii) how one prefers to be regarded by others within some social context, or (iii) how one chooses to present oneself to others within some social context." []
comment: We include (i)-(iii) to acknowledge that there are different senses of "identify" that are relevant here, and that we may not always be sure which sense the person concretizing the social identity information content entity intended. While (i) concerns how one thinks of oneself, (ii) and (iii) are more focused on one's interactions with others. Importantly, some choose not to share with others how they identify in the sense of (i). For example, one can consider oneself to be some certain gender without either wanting others to know or choosing to present oneself in a corresponding way. We distinguish (ii) and (iii) because one can prefer to be regarded some certain way without attempting to present oneself in any corresponding way.

comment: Ethnicity is separate from but related to racial identity. It refers more to identifying with a particular culture than with individuals similar in physical appearance. It includes things like Hispanic ethnicity (which spans many nations) and national cultural identities like Irish and ethnic groups within nations such as Catalan and Armenian.

[]
comment: An interesting question is whether there must be another participant who is the "educator".  Some might object that many people are "self taught".  A real case of being self taught is the first person who learned to play a stringed instrument, or to spin a ball on the tip of a finger.  There was no previous information about that type of skill.  The ICEs acquired are via one's sensory systems (vision, proprioception, auditory, etc.).\n\nOn the other hand, in the case of those who are self-taught by reading books or watching videos, or acquiring some other form of ICEs concretized outside their brain, one argument might be that the author of those ICEs somehow "plays a role" in the education, although they cannot participate in the education process itself (If I read Aristotle, and through repeated application of the information I acquire through doing so, develop the ability to write better ontology definitions, surely Aristotle did not actively participate in my particular education process, although he did influence it in a very real way).

comment: Note that by 'more advanced nature' of the competencies, we do not mean merely having more knowledge, but rather a set of competencies / capabilities that enable the person to do things of a fundamentally different nature than before. This distinction is exemplified by the difference between a Masters and a PhD degree. The PhD has a key objective of enabling the person to function as an investigator in the domain, whereas a Masters does not.

comment: Instances include any process that brings it about that some specifically dependent continuant begins to stand in a concretization relation to some generically dependent continuant, as well as any process in which someone makes use of a pre-established concretization relation. To be clear, instances do not include using concretizations of words or letters for purposes that do not make use of the concretization relations in which they stand (for example, hanging up a sign in a foreign language as a decoration because one likes the colors, despite having no idea what the sign says).

def: "A disposition that inheres in some material entity and is such that that, if realized, it is realized by either some linguistic concretization-utilization process or some linguistic concretization-interpretation process." []
comment: When realized in a concretization-utilization process, the only relevant concretization may in some cases be a cognitive one, but that suffices to realize a linguistic competence. For example, suppose one begins to write a letter, planning out the words ahead of time, but is interrupted before beginning to write and never resumes. During the process of planning out the words and what one intends to communicate, one is already concretizing words cognitively, as well as considering which combinations of words one can use to concretize additional generically dependent continuants. In doing so, one performs processes that realize one's linguistic competence, without producing any concretizations other than those cognitive ones.

The former utilizes some specifically dependent continuant that concretizes the generically dependent continuant intended to be shared, while the latter interprets that specifically dependent continuant to concretize some particular generically dependent continuant, aiming to accurately infer the other participant’s intent." []
comment: For example, if you tell someone, “It is raining,” you produce sounds that have patterns that concretize information about the weather. Your utilization of that concretization is part of the communication. When the other person hears you, they interpret those patterns to concretize something, which may or may not be the same as what you intended to convey. In other words, they interpret the sounds you produce to have meanings associated with them, and that interpretation process is another part of the communication. If a process does not have a part of each type, it is not a communication.
