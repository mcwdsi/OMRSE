Welcome to the OMRSE wiki!

The Ontology for Modeling and Representation of Social Entities or OMRSE (previously known as the Ontology of Medically Related Social Entities) is an ontology that represents various roles, processes, and dependent entities that are the product of interactions among humans (although we haven't ruled out social interactions of other species).  It began by representing various roles required for demographics, including those required to represent gender and marital status.

We welcome all contributions to OMRSE!
