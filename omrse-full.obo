comment: It's compiling "software" (scare quotes) and not "source code" because you can compile Java bytecode to machine code, and Java bytecode is not technically "source code".  Compiling source code would be a subclass of this class (as would compiling Java bytecode, etc.).
comment: Source code can be automatically generated to some extent, but we're assuming humans still curate it minimally. Also, in the case of Java and its JVM, it's machine interpretable instructions, not directly executable. Ditto for other languages with intermediate form like Java byte code.

Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay.

However, this does not mean that fiat object parts are dependent for their existence on divisions or delineations effected by cognitive subjects. If, for example, it is correct to conceive geological layers of the Earth as fiat object parts of the Earth, then even though these layers were first delineated in recent times, still existed long before such delineation and what holds of these layers (for example that the oldest layers are also the lowest layers) did not begin to hold because of our acts of delineation.Treatment of material entity in BFOExamples viewed by some as problematic cases for the trichotomy of fiat object part, object, and object aggregate include: a mussel on (and attached to) a rock, a slime mold, a pizza, a cloud, a galaxy, a railway train with engine and multiple carriages, a clonal stand of quaking aspen, a bacterial community (biofilm), a broken femur. Note that, as Aristotle already clearly recognized, such problematic cases – which lie at or near the penumbra of instances defined by the categories in question – need not invalidate these categories. The existence of grey objects does not prove that there are not objects which are black and objects which are white; the existence of mules does not prove that there are not objects which are donkeys and objects which are horses. It does, however, show that the examples in question need to be addressed carefully in order to show how they can be fitted into the proposed scheme, for example by recognizing additional subdivisions [29" xsd:string

Such units play a central role in almost all domains of natural science from particle physics to cosmology. Many scientific laws govern the units in question, employing general terms (such as ‘molecule’ or ‘planet’) referring to the types and subtypes of units, and also to the types and subtypes of the processes through which such units develop and interact. The division of reality into such natural units is at the heart of biological science, as also is the fact that these units may form higher-level units (as cells form multicellular organisms) and that they may also form aggregates of units, for example as cells form portions of tissue and organs form families, herds, breeds, species, and so on. At the same time, the division of certain portions of reality into engineered units (manufactured artifacts) is the basis of modern industrial technology, which rests on the distributed mass production of engineered parts through division of labor and on their assembly into larger, compound units such as cars and laptops. The division of portions of reality into units is one starting point for the phenomenon of counting." xsd:string

Even knowledgeable and experienced scientists can benefit from computational tools that help navigate this vast and rapidly evolving terrain. In this paper, we describe a novel computational approach to this challenge, a knowledge-based system that combines reading, reasoning and reporting methods to facilitate analysis of experimental data. Reading methods extract information from external resources, either by parsing structured data or biomedical language processing to extract information from unstructured data, and track knowledge provenance.  Reasoning methods enrich the knowledge that results from reading by, for example, noting two genes that are annotated to the same ontology term or database entry.  Reasoning is also used to combine all sources into a knowledge network that represents the integration of all sorts of relationships between a pair of genes, and to calculate a combined reliability score. Reporting methods combine the knowledge network with a congruent network constructed from experimental data and visualize the combined network in a tool that facilitates the knowledge-based analysis of that data." xsd:string

These studies require additional functional evaluation of candidate genes, including their possible interaction with diet and environment. The number of candidate genes is typically large and the development of appropriate genetic tools in mammalian systems is slow. By contrast, large-scale genetic screens, using widely available genetic tools, are routinely conducted in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, we used Drosophila to screen candidate genes identified in human genome-wide scans as associated with risk of metabolic abnormalities such as type 2 diabetes. We show that a number of human candidate genes have fly orthologs that play an important role in Drosophila tolerance to high dietary sucrose. We further explored some of the specific metabolic abnormalities that can result when these genes’ activities are reduced in flies, focusing on a gene we call dHHEX (CG7056), the fly ortholog of human HHEX." xsd:string

name: code set
def: "An information content entity that is a collection of other information content entities that has been created to identify or annotate things in a specified domain, and where the intention of its creators is that the collection has a one-to-one correspondence with those things." []
comment: Code sets might include non-entities/things (e.g. missing thumbs).
comment: Does not imply absence vs. presence of any taxonomy.
comment: Does not imply that aggregated entities denote particulars, universals, or defined classes (a.k.a. attributive collections) or even that they denote only one of these three types of entities.
comment: Each aggregated entity is often (but not necessarily) associated with a text string—variously called a “description,” “name,” “title,” or “label”—that helps humans reach the target of denotation.\n\nWhen there is no such string, it is almost always because the entities take the form of human language words. For example, a “sex” or “gender” code set could contain “MALE” and “FEMALE,” or even “M” and “F” (by convention, we understand what these mean).
comment: For each given domain, there can potentially exist multiple code sets. The multiplicity of code sets is partially due to the different specific purposes of those code sets.
comment: For National Drug Codes (NDCs) and similar code sets, there doesn’t even have to be a single, fully-concretized copy somewhere (for example, for NDCs there is no centralized database or repository where they all live as one instance of concretization of code set). The code set can be “distributively” concretized. This seems like an unusual exception, but it also likely applies to Universal Product Codes (UPCs) and their follow on Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs).
comment: Many code sets are created for a specific purpose in addition to merely identifying or annotating core ideas of a specified domain.
comment: The information content entities do not denote each other.

comment: The phrase "in need of being perceived" does not imply that only planned processes that are in fact perceived can be social acts. Reinach clarifies that by exemplifying these matters for commands: "The command is according to its essence in need of being heard (vernehmungsbedürtig". It can of course happen that commands are given without being heard. Then they fail to fulfil their purpose. They are like thrown spears which fall to the ground without hitting their target." (A. Reinach: The Apriori Foundations of the Civil Law." Edited by J. Crosby, Heusenstamm: ontos Verlag, 2012).\nReinach clearly does not imply that a command that does not fulfill its prupose would not be a command.\nThanks to W.R. Hogan for finding the Reinach quote.

Here is the entire email summary, on which the definition is based:\n\n1) there are organization_member_roles (president, treasurer, branch\neditor), with individual persons as bearers\n\n2) there are organization_roles (employer, owner, vendor, patent holder)\n\n3) an organization has a charter / rules / bylaws, which specify what roles\nthere are, how they should be realized, and how to modify the\ncharter/rules/bylaws themselves.\n\nIt is debatable what the organization itself is (some kind of dependent\ncontinuant or an aggregate of people). This also determines who/what the\nbearer of organization_roles' are. My personal favorite is still to define\norganization as a kind of 'legal entity', but thinking it through leads to\nall kinds of questions that are clearly outside the scope of OBI.\n\nInterestingly enough, it does not seem to matter much where we place\norganization itself, as long as we can subclass it (University, Corporation,\nGovernment Agency, Hospital), instantiate it (Affymetrix, NCBI, NIH, ISO,\nW3C, University of Oklahoma), and have it play roles.\n\nThis leads to my proposal: We define organization through the statements 1 -\n3 above, but without an 'is a' statement for now.

comment: We are aware of the fact that Wikipedia's definition differs from ours by saying that "Legal personality (...) is the characteristic of a non-living entity regarded by law to have the status of personhood" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_personality) \nHowever, Shaw explicates:\n"In any legal system, certain entities, whether they be individuals or companies, will be regarded as possessing rights and duties enforceable at law. Thus an individual may prosecute or be prosecuted for assault and a company can sue for breach of contract. They are able to do this because the law recognises them as 'legal persons' possessing the capacity to have and to maintain certain rights, and being subject to perform specific duties. (...) In municipal law individuals, limited companies and public corporations are recognized as each possessing a distinct legal personality, the terms of which are circumscribed by the relevant legislation" (Shaw MN: International Law. Sixth Edition. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2008).                We hold that Shaw's position is ontological more prolific since it not only allows to explain how groups of individuals become recognized as unities at law, but also how different individuals can hold different legal personality roles (always against the context of one legal system). The latter will proof useful when dealing with the representing comatous patients or minorsat law in ontologies.

def: "A health care facility that bears a function to provide low intensity healthcare services to patients on a short-term basis, with patients leaving on the same date as arriving (i.e., without them staying overnight)" []
comment: Broadened from treatment to healthcare services generally.  "Low intensity" is not defined at the moment, but is needed to differentiate from same-day surgery centers or observation stays in hospitals that last <24 hours.  The idea is that few invasive procedures are performed, and the ones that are invasive are not typically much worse than a blood draw.  Maybe bone marrow biopsy is as aggressive as it gets.  I wonder if hematologists do that on an outpatient basis.

[]
comment: We include (i)-(iii) to acknowledge that there are different senses of "identify" that are relevant here, and that we may not always be sure which sense the person concretizing the social identity information content entity intended. While (i) concerns how one thinks of oneself, (ii) and (iii) are more focused on one's interactions with others. Importantly, some choose not to share with others how they identify in the sense of (i). For example, one can consider oneself to be some certain gender without either wanting others to know or choosing to present oneself in a corresponding way. We distinguish (ii) and (iii) because one can prefer to be regarded some certain way without attempting to present oneself in any corresponding way.

comment: It covers prescription claims because pharmacies bill insurance companies for patients’ prescriptions via submitting insurance claims.
comment: The insurance claim is submitted to the insurance company by either the patient or the provider. It is not necessarily always the provider, although in the United States, it typically is.
comment: The outcome of the adjudication of a claim in the claims dataset could be favorable or unfavorable for the healthcare provider, the patient, or both. The idea is just that they’ve been adjudicated, one way or the other (or anything in between if that’s a possibility).
comment: The reason we say billing data are only part of the input is because we are not conflating the insurance claim with the bill. It is our understanding that the provider’s bill of services is either part of the claim or “attached” to it in some manner, but doesn’t constitute the entire claim itself.
comment: The sources of these data are held by insurers or other health plan providers.

[]
comment: An interesting question is whether there must be another participant who is the "educator".  Some might object that many people are "self taught".  A real case of being self taught is the first person who learned to play a stringed instrument, or to spin a ball on the tip of a finger.  There was no previous information about that type of skill.  The ICEs acquired are via one's sensory systems (vision, proprioception, auditory, etc.).\n\nOn the other hand, in the case of those who are self-taught by reading books or watching videos, or acquiring some other form of ICEs concretized outside their brain, one argument might be that the author of those ICEs somehow "plays a role" in the education, although they cannot participate in the education process itself (If I read Aristotle, and through repeated application of the information I acquire through doing so, develop the ability to write better ontology definitions, surely Aristotle did not actively participate in my particular education process, although he did influence it in a very real way).
comment: The loss of a "bad" capability is something like losing a bad golf swing and replacing it with a good one.  Also a capability to disrupt the classroom might be something an educating process diminishes possibly to the point of "removal" in a student.\n\nThis addition to the definition notwithstanding, we do not intend to incorporate the receipt of punishment into the definition of educating.

def: "A socio-economic data item that is about a person and their completion of at least some of the required courses of an education program, where the set of planned competencies to be acquired by completing that program, as a whole, are of a more advanced nature than the set of competencies acquired through any other educational program completed by the person." []
comment: Note that by 'more advanced nature' of the competencies, we do not mean merely having more knowledge, but rather a set of competencies / capabilities that enable the person to do things of a fundamentally different nature than before. This distinction is exemplified by the difference between a Masters and a PhD degree. The PhD has a key objective of enabling the person to function as an investigator in the domain, whereas a Masters does not.
comment: This data item in a typical attribute-value system such as table, XML, JSON takes values like "secondary education", "Associate Degree", "Bachelor Degree", "High School", and so on.\n\nAlso, note that we revised the definition in collaboration with our APRICOT project colleagues who noted that the individual need not have completed one of the education programs in a sequence, instead demonstrating competencies for admission to the highest level of eductation in some alternative way. For example, the highest level of education might be baccalaureate degree, but the individual did not graduate a secondary education program but instead got a General Educational Development (GED) certification / degree.

comment: Vocational education programs are designed for learners to acquire the knowledge, skills and competencies specific to a particular occupation, trade, or class of occupations or trades. Such programs may have work-based components (e.g. apprenticeships, dual-system education programmes). Successful completion of such programs leads to labor market-relevant, vocational qualifications acknowledged as occupationally-oriented by the relevant national authorities and/or the labor market.

comment: When realized in a concretization-utilization process, the only relevant concretization may in some cases be a cognitive one, but that suffices to realize a linguistic competence. For example, suppose one begins to write a letter, planning out the words ahead of time, but is interrupted before beginning to write and never resumes. During the process of planning out the words and what one intends to communicate, one is already concretizing words cognitively, as well as considering which combinations of words one can use to concretize additional generically dependent continuants. In doing so, one performs processes that realize one's linguistic competence, without producing any concretizations other than those cognitive ones.

[]
comment: For example, if you tell someone, “It is raining,” you produce sounds that have patterns that concretize information about the weather. Your utilization of that concretization is part of the communication. When the other person hears you, they interpret those patterns to concretize something, which may or may not be the same as what you intended to convey. In other words, they interpret the sounds you produce to have meanings associated with them, and that interpretation process is another part of the communication. If a process does not have a part of each type, it is not a communication.

The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string

def: "relation that links two events, processes, states, or objects such that one event, process, state, or object (a cause) contributes to the production of another event, process, state, or object (an effect) where the cause is partly or wholly responsible for the effect, and the effect is partly or wholly dependent on the cause." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality]
property_value: IAO:0000116 "This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative?\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string
