The Ontology for Modeling and Representation of Social Entities (OMRSE) is an OBO Foundry ontology that represents the various entities that arise from human social interactions, such as social acts, social roles, social groups, and organizations. For more information on the social entities represented in OMRSE, please visit our [wiki page](https://github.com/mcwdsi/OMRSE/wiki) or list of publications. OMRSE is designed to be a mid-level ontology that bridges the gap between BFO, which it reuses for its top-level hierarchy, and more specific domain or application ontologies. For this reason, we are always open to working with ontology developers who want to build interoperability between their projects and OMRSE. A list of projects we currently collaborate with or that reuse OMRSE classes is listed below.
